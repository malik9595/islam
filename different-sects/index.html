      When all the Muslims follow one and the same Qur’an, then why are there so
      many sects and different schools of thought among Muslims?
    </h1>
    <h3>Muslims should be United</h3>
    <article>
      <em
        >“And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah (stretches out
        for you), and be not divided among yourselves;”</em
      >&nbsp;[Al-Qur’an 3:103] <br /><br />
      Which is the rope of Allah that is being referred to in this verse? It is
      the Glorious Qur’an and the Sahih Hadith. The Glorious Qur’an and the
      authentic Hadith are the rope of Allah, which all Muslims should hold fast
      together. There is double emphasis in this verse. Besides saying ‘hold
      fast all together’ it also says, ‘be not divided’.
      <br /><br />
      The Glorious Qur’an further says,
      <br /><br />
      <em>“Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger…”</em>&nbsp;[Al-Qur’an 4:59]
      <br /><br />All the Muslims should follow the Qur’an and authentic Ahadith
      and be not divided among themselves.
    </article>
    <h3>It is Prohibited to make sects and divisions in Islam</h3>
    <article>
      <em
        >“As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, thou
        hast no part in them in the least: their affair is with Allah: He will
        in the end tell them the truth of all that they did.”</em
      >&nbsp;[Al-Qur’an 6:159] <br /><br />
      But when one asks a Muslim, “who are you?”, the common answer is either ‘I
      am a Sunni, or ‘I am Shia’. Some call themselves Hanafi, or Shafa’ee or
      Maaliki or Hambali. Some say ‘I am a Deobandi’, while some others say ‘I
      am a Barelvi.’

    <h3>Our Prophet (pbuh) was a Muslim</h3>
    <article>
      One may ask such Muslims, “What was our beloved Prophet (pbuh)? Was he a
      Hanafi or a Shafa’ee, or a Hambali or a Maaliki?” No! He was a Muslim,
      like all the other prophets and messengers of Allah before him.
      <br /><br />
      It is mentioned in Surah Aali Imraan Chapter 3 Verse 52 of the Glorious
      Qur’an that Jesus (pbuh) was a Muslim.
      <br /><br />
      Further, in Surah Aali Imraan Chapter 3 Verse 67, the Glorious Qur’an says
      that Ibraheem (pbuh) was not a Jew or a Christian but was a Muslim.
    </article>
    <h3>The Qur’an says to call yourselves a Muslim</h3>
    <article>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          If anyone poses a Muslim the question who are you, he should say, “I
          am a MUSLIM”, not a Hanafi or a Shafa’ee. Nowhere does the Qur’an say
          that you should call yourself a Hanafi or a Shafe’ee. Surah Fussilat
          Chapter 41 Verse 33 says:
          <br /><br />
          <em
            >“Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to Allah, works
            righteousness, and says, ‘I am of those who bow in Islam
            (Muslim)?”</em
          >&nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 41:33] <br /><br />
          The Qur’an says, “Say: I am of those who bow in Islam.” In other
          words, say, “I am a Muslim”.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Prophet (pbuh) dictated letters to non-Muslim kings and rulers
          inviting them to accept Islam. In these letters he mentioned the verse
          of the Qur’an from Surah Aali Imraan Chapter 3 Verse 64:
          <br /><br />
          <em
            >Say ye: “Bear witness that we (at least) are Muslims (bowing to
            Allah’s Will).”</em
          >&nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 3:64]
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Respect all the Great Scholars of Islam</h3>
    <article>
      We must respect all the great scholars of Islam, including the four
      Imaams, Imaam Abu Haneefah, Imaam Shafa’ee, Imaam Hambal and Imaam Maalik
      (may Allah have mercy on all of them). They were great scholars and may
      Allah reward them for their research and hard work. One can have no
      objection if someone agrees with the views and research of Imaam Abu
      Haneefah or Imam Shafa’ee, etc. But when posed a question, ‘who are you?’,
      the reply should only be ‘I am a Muslim’
      <br /><br />
      Some may argue by quoting the hadith of our beloved Prophet (pbuh) from
      Sunan Abu Dawood Vol. 5, The Book of Sunnah, Chapter No. 1, Hadith No.
      4596. In this hadith the Prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said, “My
      Ummah (community) will be split up into seventy-three sects.”
      <br /><br />
      This hadith reports that the Prophet (pbuh) predicted the emergence of
      seventy-three sects. He did not say that Muslims should be active in
      dividing themselves into sects. The Glorious Qur’an commands us not to
      make sects. Those who follow the teachings of the Qur’an and Sahih Hadith
      and do not make sects are the people who are on the true path.
      <br /><br />
      According to Sunan Al Tirmidhi, Vol. 5, Hadith No. 2641, the Prophet
      (pbuh) is reported to have said, “…My Ummah will split into seventythree
      sects. All of them will be in Hellfire except one sect.” The companions
      asked Allah’s messenger, which group that would be? Where upon he (pbuh)
      replied, “It is the one to which I and my companions belong.”
      <br /><br />
      The Glorious Qur’an mentions in several verses, “Obey Allah and obey His
      Messenger.” A true Muslim should only follow the Glorious Qur’an and the
      Sahih Hadith. He can agree with the views of any scholar as long as they
      conform to the teachings of the Qur’an and Sahih Hadith. If such views go
      against the Word of Allah, or the Sunnah of His Prophet, then they carry
      no weight, regardless of how learned the scholar might be.
      <br /><br />
      If only all Muslims read the Qur’an with understanding and adhere to Sahih
      Hadith, In sha Allah most of these differences would be solved and we
      could be one united Muslim Ummah.
