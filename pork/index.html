    <h1>Why is the eating of pork forbidden in Islam?</h1>
    <article>
      The fact that consumption of pork is prohibited in Islam is well known.
      The following points explain various aspects of this prohibition:
    </article>
    <h3>Pork prohibited in the Qur’an</h3>
    <article>
      The Qur’an prohibits the consumption of pork in no less than 4 different
      places. It is prohibited in Surah Al Baqarah 2:173, Surah Al Maa’idah 5:3,
      Surah Al An’aam 6:145 and Surah Al Nahl 16:115:
      <br /><br />
      <em
        >“Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine,
        and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah…”</em
      >&nbsp;[Al-Qur’an 5:3] <br /><br />
      The above verses of the Glorious Qur’an are sufficient to satisfy a Muslim
      as to why pork is forbidden.

    <h3>Pork prohibited in the Bible</h3>
    <article>
      The Christian is likely to be convinced by his religious scriptures. The
      Bible prohibits the consumption of pork, in the Book of Leviticus:
      <br /><br />
      <em
        >“And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he
        cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.”</em
      >
      <br /><br />
      <em
        >“Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch,
        they are unclean to you.”</em
      >&nbsp;[Leviticus 11:7-8] <br /><br />
      Pork is also prohibited in the Bible in the Book of Deuteronomy: <br />
      <em
        >“And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud,
        it is unclean unto you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their
        dead carcass.”</em
      >
      &nbsp; [Deuteronomy 14:8] <br /><br />
      A similar prohibition is repeated in the Bible in the Book of Isaiah
      Chapter 65 Verses 2-5.

    <h3>Consumption of pork causes several diseases</h3>
    <article>
      The other non-Muslims and atheists will agree only if convinced through
      reason, logic and science. Eating of pork can cause no less than seventy
      different types of diseases. A person can have various helminths like
      roundworm, pinworm, hookworm, etc. One of the most dangerous is Taenia
      Solium, which is in layman’s terminology called tapeworm. It harbours in
      the intestine and is very long. It’s ova i.e. eggs, enter the blood stream
      and can reach almost all the organs of the body. If it enters the brain it
      can cause memory loss. If it enters the heart it can cause heart attack,
      if it enters the eye it can cause blindness, if it enters the liver it can
      cause liver damage. It can damage almost all the organs of the body.
      <br /><br />
      Another dangerous helminths is Trichura Tichurasis. A common misconception
      about pork is that if it is cooked well, these ova die. In a research
      project undertaken in America, it was found that out of twenty-four people
      suffering from Trichura Tichurasis, twenty-two had cooked the pork very
      well. This indicates that the ovas present in the pork do not die under
      normal cooking temperature.

    <h3>Pork has fat building material</h3>
    <article>
      Pork has very little muscle building material and contains excess of fat.
      This fat gets deposited in the vessels and can cause hypertension and
      heart attack. It is not surprising that over 50% of Americans suffer from
      hypertension.

    <h3>Pig is one of the filthiest animals on earth</h3>
    <article>
        The pig is one of the filthiest animals on earth. It lives and thrives on muck,
faeces and dirt. It is the best scavenger that I know that God has produced.
In the villages they don’t have modern toilets and the villagers excrete in the open air. Very often excreta is cleared by the pigs. 
<br><br>
Some may argue that in advanced countries like Australia, pigs are bred in
very clean and hygienic conditions. Even in these hygienic conditions the pigs
are kept together in sties. No matter how hard you try to keep them clean
they are filthy by nature. They eat and enjoy their own as well as their
neighbour’s excreta.
<br><br>
Some may argue that even the chickens eat the excreta. The chicken does
many a time peck the excreta and dirt but does not survive on it. The chicken
has a second stomach i.e. the gizzard. Whenever the chicken consumes faeces
and other dirt, it enters the gizzard and is directly excreted. On the other
hand, the pig has only one stomach and everything passes through the normal
digestive system. Therefore, the pork also contains this dirt, which is indirectly
consumed while eating pork.

    <h3>Pig is the most shameless animal</h3>
    <article>
        The pig is the most shameless animal on the face of the earth. It is the only
animal that invites its friends to have sex with its mate. In America, most
people consume pork. Many times after dance parties, they have swapping of
wives i.e. many say “you sleep with my wife and I will sleep with your wife”. If
you eat pigs then you behave like pigs. We Indians look upon America to be
very advanced and sophisticated. Whatever they do, we follow after a few
years. According to an article in Island magazine, this practice of swapping
wives has become common in the affluent circles of Mumbai.
