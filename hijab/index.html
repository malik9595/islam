    <h1>Why does Islam degrade women by keeping them behind the veil?</h1>
    <article>
      The status of women in Islam is often the target of attacks in the secular
      media. The ‘hijaab’ or the Islamic dress is cited by many as an example of
      the ‘subjugation’ of women under Islamic law. Before we analyze the
      reasoning behind the religiously mandated ‘hijaab’, let us first study the
      status of women in societies before the advent of Islam.

    <h3>In the past women were degraded and used as objects of lust</h3>
    <article>
      The following examples from history amply illustrate the fact that the
      status of women in earlier civilizations was very low to the extent that
      they were denied basic human dignity: <br /><br />
      <strong>Babylonian Civilization:</strong> <br />
      The women were degraded and were denied all rights under the Babylonian
      law. If a man murdered a woman, instead of him being punished, his wife
      was put to death. <br /><br />
      <strong>Greek Civilization:</strong> <br />
      Greek Civilization is considered the most glorious of all ancient
      civilizations. Under this very ‘glorious’ system, women were deprived of
      all rights and were looked down upon. In Greek mythology, an ‘imaginary
      woman’ called ‘Pandora’ is the root cause of misfortune of human beings.
      The Greeks considered women to be subhuman and inferior to men. Though
      chastity of women was precious, and women were held in high esteem, the
      Greeks were later overwhelmed by ego and sexual perversions. Prostitution
      became a regular practice amongst all classes of Greek society.
      <br /><br />
      <strong> Roman Civilization:</strong><br />
      When Roman Civilization was at the zenith of its ‘glory’, a man even had
      the right to take the life of his wife. Prostitution and nudity were
      common amongst the Romans. <br /><br />
      <strong>Egyptian Civilization: </strong> <br />
      The Egyptians considered women evil and as a sign of a devil. <br /><br />
      <strong> Pre-Islamic Arabia:</strong><br />
      Before Islam spread in Arabia, the Arabs looked down upon women and very
      often when a female child was born, she was buried alive.

    <h3>
      Islam uplifted women and gave them equality and expects them to maintain
      their status
    </h3>
    <article>
      Islam uplifted the status of women and granted them their just rights 1400
      years ago. Islam expects women to maintain their status. <br /><br />
      <strong>Hijaab for men</strong> <br />
      People usually only discuss ‘hijaab’ in the context of women. However, in
      the Glorious Qur’an, Allah (swt) first mentions ‘hijaab’ for the men
      before ‘hijaab’ for the women. The Qur’an mentions in Surah Al Noor:
      <br />
      <em
        >“Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard
        their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: and Allah is
        well acquainted with all that they do.”</em
      >[Al-Qur’an 24:30]
      <br />
      The moment a man looks at a woman and if any brazen or unashamed thought
      comes to his mind, he should lower his gaze.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Hijaab for women</strong><br />
      The next verse of Surah Al Noor, says: <br />
      <em
        >“And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and
        guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and
        ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should
        draw veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to
        their husbands, their fathers, their husbands’ fathers, their
        sons...”</em
      >
      <br />
      [Al-Qur’an 24:31]

    <h3>Six criteria for Hijaab</h3>
    <article>
      According to Qur’an and Sahih Hadith there are basically six criteria for
      observing hijaab:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Extent:</strong>
          The first criterion is the extent of the body that should be covered.
          This is different for men and women. The extent of Hijaab for the male
          is to cover the body at least from the navel to the knees. For women,
          the complete body should be covered except the face and the hands upto
          the wrists. If they wish to, they can cover even these parts of the
          body. Some scholars of Islam insist that the face and the hands are
          also part of the obligatory extent of ‘hijaab’.
          <br /><br />
          All the remaining five criteria are the same for men and women.
        </li>
        <li>
          The clothes worn should be loose and should not reveal the figure.
        </li>
        <li>
          The clothes worn should not be transparent or translucent such that
          one can see through them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The clothes worn should not be so glamorous as to attract the opposite
          sex.
        </li>
        <li>The clothes worn should not resemble that of the opposite sex</li>
        <li>
          The clothes worn should not resemble that of the unbelievers i.e. they
          should not wear clothes that are specifically identities or symbols of
          the unbelievers’ religions.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>
    <h3>Hijaab includes conduct and behaviour among other things</h3>
    <article>
      Complete ‘hijaab’, besides the six criteria of clothing, also includes the
      moral conduct, behaviour, attitude and intention of the individual. A
      person only fulfilling the criteria of ‘hijaab’ of the clothes is
      observing ‘hijaab’ in a limited sense. ‘Hijaab’ of the clothes should be
      accompanied by ‘hijaab’ of the eyes, ‘hijaab’ of the heart, ‘hijaab’ of
      thought and ‘hijaab’ of intention. It also includes the way a person
      walks, the way a person talks, the way a person behaves, etc.
    </article>
    <h3>Hijaab prevents molestation</h3>
    <article>
      The reason why Hijaab is prescribed for women is mentioned in the Qur’an
      in the following Verse of Surah Al-Ahzaab: <br />
      <em>
        “O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women that
        they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad);
        that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not
        molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </em
      >[Al-Qur’an 33:59] <br /><br />
      The Qur’an says that Hijaab has been prescribed for the women so that they
      are recognized as modest women and this will also prevent them from being
      molested.
    </article>
    <h3>Example of twin sisters</h3>
    <article>
      Suppose two sisters who are twins, and who are equally beautiful, walk
      down the street. One of them is wearing the Islamic Hijaab i.e. the
      complete body is covered, except for the face and the hands up to the
      wrists. The other sister is wearing western clothes, a mini-skirt or
      shorts with a low neckline. Just around the corner there is a hooligan or
      ruffian who is waiting for a catch, to tease a girl. Whom will he tease?
      The girl wearing the Islamic Hijaab or the girl wearing the skirt or the
      mini with a low neckline? Naturally he will tease the girl wearing the
      skirt or the mini with a low neckline. Such dresses which expose more than
      what they cover are an indirect invitation to the opposite sex for teasing
      and molestation. The Qur’an rightly says that Hijaab prevents women from
      being molested.

    <h3>Capital punishment for the rapists</h3>
    <article>
      Under the Islamic Shari’ah, a man convicted of having raped a woman, is
      given capital punishment. Many are astonished at this ‘harsh’ sentence.
      Some non-Muslims may say that ‘Capital punishment in this age of science
      and technology! Islam is a ruthless, barbaric religion!’ I have asked a
      simple question to hundreds of non-Muslim men. Suppose, God forbid,
      someone rapes your wife, your mother or your sister. You are made the
      judge and the rapist is brought in front of you. What punishment would you
      give him? All of them said they would put him to death. Some went to the
      extent of saying they would torture him to death. To them I ask, if
      someone rapes your wife or your mother you want to put him to death. But
      if the same crime is committed on somebody else’s wife or daughter, you
      say capital punishment is barbaric. Why should there be double standards?
    </article>
    <h3>Western society falsely claims to have uplifted women</h3>
    <article>
      Western talk of women’s liberalization is nothing but a disguised form of
      exploitation of her body, degradation of her soul, and deprivation of her
      honour. Western society claims to have ‘uplifted’ women. On the contrary
      it has actually degraded them to the status of concubines, mistresses and
      society butterflies who are mere tools in the hands of pleasure seekers
      and sex marketeers, hidden behind the colourful screen of ‘art’ and
      ‘culture’.

    <h3>USA has one of the highest rates of rape</h3>
    <article>
      United States of America is supposed to be one of the most advanced
      countries of the world. It also has one of the highest rates of rape in
      any country in the world. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in
      the year 2005, every day on an average 1997 cases of rape were committed
      in USA alone. A decade later according to the U.S. Department of Justice,
      in the year 2014 on an average everyday 2318 cases of rape were committed
      in USA. May be the Americans got ‘bolder’ in a decade. Every 37 seconds
      one rape is being committed in USA.
      <br /><br />
      Consider a scenario where the Islamic Shari’ah is implemented in America.
      Whenever a man looks at a woman and any brazen or unashamed thought comes
      to his mind, he lowers his gaze. Every woman wears the Islamic Hijaab that
      is the complete body is covered except the face and the hands upto the
      wrists. After this if any man commits rape he is given capital punishment.
      I ask you, in such a scenario, will the rate of rape in America increase,
      will it remain the same, or will it decrease?
    </article>
    <h3>Implementation of Islamic Shar’iah will reduce the rate of rapes</h3>
    <article>
      Naturally as soon as Islamic Shar’iah is implemented positive results will
      be inevitable. If Islamic Shar’iah is implemented in any part of the
      world, whether it is America, Europe or India, society will breathe
      easier. Hijaab does not degrade a woman but uplifts a woman and protects
      her modesty and chastity.
