    <h3>Specific shares of inheritance for the relatives</h3>
    <article>
      There are three verses in the Qur’an that broadly describe the share of
      close relatives i.e. Surah Al Nisaa’, Chapter 4, Verses 11, 12 and 176.
      The verses are as follows:
      <br /><br />
      <em>
        “Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to
        the male, a portion equal to that of two females, if only daughters, two
        or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her
        share is a half
        <br /><br />
        For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased
        left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the
        mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters) the
        mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment
        of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children
        are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by
        Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.”
      </em>
      <br /><br />
      <em>
        “In what your wives leave, your share is half if they leave no child;
        but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies
        and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth if ye leave no
        child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of
        legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in
        question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a
        brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than
        two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that
        no loss is caused (to anyone). Thus it is ordained by Allah; and Allah
        is AllKnowing Most Forbearing.”
      </em>
      &nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 4:11-12] <br /><br />
      <em>
        “They ask thee for a legal decision. Say: Allah directs (them) about
        those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If it is a man
        that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have half the
        inheritance. If (such a deceased was) a woman who left no child, her
        brother takes her inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have
        two thirds of the inheritance (between them). If there are brothers and
        sisters, (they share), the male having twice the share of the female.
        Thus doth Allah makes clear to you (His law), lest ye err. And Allah
        hath knowledge of all things.” </em
      >&nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 4:176]

    <h3>Female sometimes inherits same or more than the male counterpart</h3>
    <article>
      In most of the cases, a woman inherits half of what her male counterpart
      inherits. However, this is not always the case. In case the deceased has
      left no ascendant or descendent but has left the uterine brother and
      sister, each of the two inherits one sixth. If the deceased has left
      children, both the parents that is the mother and the father get an equal
      share and inherit one sixth each. In certain cases, a woman can also
      inherit a share that is double that of the male. If the deceased is a
      woman who has left no children, brothers or sisters and is survived only
      by her husband, mother and father, the husband inherits half the property
      while the mother inherits one third and the father the remaining one
      sixth. In this particular case, the mother inherits a share that is double
      that of the father.

    <h3>
      Female usually inherits half the share of that of the male counterpart
    </h3>
    <article>
      It is true that as a general rule, in most cases, the female inherits a
      share that is half that of the male. For instance in the following cases:
      <br /><br />
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Daughter inherits half of what the son inherits.</li>
        <li>
          Wife inherits 1/4th and husband 1/2 if the deceased has no children.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wife inherits 1/8th and husband 1/4th if the deceased has children.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the deceased has no ascendant or descendent, the sister inherits a
          share that is half that of the brother.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>
    <h3>
      Male inherits double than the female because he financially supports
    </h3>
    <article>
      the family In Islam, a woman has no financial obligation and the
      economical responsibility lies on the shoulders of the man. Before a woman
      is married it is the duty of the father or brother to look after the
      lodging, boarding, clothing and other financial requirements of the woman.
      After she is married it is the duty of the husband or the son. Since the
      financial burden to look after the family is put on the men, in order to
      do justice to this responsibility they get double the share of
      inheritance.
      <br><br>
      For example, if a man dies leaving about One Hundred and Fifty Thousand
Dollars for the children (i.e one son and one daughter), the son inherits One
Hundred Thousand Dollars and the daughter only Fifty Thousand Dollars. Out
of the One Hundred Thousand Dollars which the son inherits, as his duty
towards his family, he may have to spend on them almost the entire amount
or say about Eighty Thousand Dollars and thus he has a small percentage of
inheritance, say about Twenty Thousand Dollars, left for himself. On the other
hand, the daughter, who inherits Fifty Thousand Dollars, is not bound to
spend a single penny on anybody. She can keep the entire amount for herself.
Would you prefer inheriting One Hundred Thousand Dollars and spending
Eighty Thousand Dollars from it, or inheriting Fifty Thousand Dollars and
having the entire amount for yourself?
