    <title>Why Islam Prohibits Polyandry and Allows Polygyny</title>

      If a man is allowed to have more than one wife, then why does Islam
      prohibit a woman from having more than one husband?
    </h3>
    <article>
      A lot of people, including some Muslims, question the logic of allowing
      Muslim men to have more than one spouse while denying the same ‘right’ to
      women.
      <br /><br />
      Let me first state emphatically, that the foundation of an Islamic society
      is justice and equity. Allah has created men and women as equal, but with
      different capabilities and different responsibilities. Men and women are
      different, physiologically and psychologically. Their roles and
      responsibilities are different. Men and women are equal in Islam, but not
      identical.
      <br /><br />
      Surah Al Nisaa’ Chapter 4 verses 22 to 24 gives the list of women with
      whom you can not marry and it is further mentioned in Surah Al Nisaa’
      Chapter 4 verse 24,
      <br /><br />
      <em>“Also (prohibited are) women already married” </em> [Al-Qur’an 4:24]
      <br /><br />
      The following points enumerate the reasons why polyandry is prohibited in
      Islam:
      <br /><br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          If a man has more than one wife, the parents of the children born of
          such marriages can easily be identified. The father as well as the
          mother can easily be identified. In case of a woman marrying more than
          one husband, only the mother of the children born of such marriages
          will be identified and not the father. Islam gives tremendous
          importance to the identification of both parents, mother and father.
          Psychologists tell us that children who do not know their parents,
          especially their father undergo severe mental trauma and disturbances.
          Often they have an unhappy childhood. It is for this reason that the
          children of prostitutes do not have a healthy childhood. If a child
          born of such wedlock is admitted in school, and when the mother is
          asked the name of the father, she would have to give two or more
          names! I am aware that recent advances in science have made it
          possible for both the mother and father to be identified with the help
          of genetic testing. Even if we agree that the test is 100% accurate,
          this test was discovered recently and this is not the only reason for
          not allowing Polyandry.
        </li>
        <li>Man is more polygamous by nature as compared to a woman.</li>
        <li>
          Biologically, it is easier for a man to perform his duties as a
          husband despite having several wives. A woman, in a similar position,
          having several husbands, will not find it possible to perform her
          duties as a wife. A woman undergoes several psychological and
          behavioural changes due to different phases of the menstrual cycle and
          also due to the release of sex hormones, oestrogen. The mental state
          of a woman is not as stable as compared to normal times. According to
          a report, most crimes committed by women in USA, are done during their
          menstrual periods.
          <br /><br />
          A woman has more chances of having a quarrel or disagreement with the
          husband during these periods. Therefore, Islam prohibits a man to give
          divorce to his wife while she undergoes her menstrual cycle. Thus, in
          polyandrous marriages, for a woman to have good relations with more
          than one husband at the same time will be too much of a mental trauma.
        </li>
        <li>
          A woman who has more than one husband will have several sexual
          partners at the same time and has a high chance of acquiring venereal
          or sexually transmitted diseases, which can also be transmitted back
          to her husband even if all of them have no extra-marital sex. This is
          not the case in a man having more than one wife, and none of them
          having extramarital sex.
          <br /><br />
          The above reasons are those that one can easily identify. There are
          probably many more reasons why Allah, in His Infinite Wisdom, has
          prohibited polyandry.
