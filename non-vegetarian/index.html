      Killing an animal is a ruthless act. Why then do Muslims consume
      nonvegetarian food?
    </h1>
    <h3>A Muslim can be a pure vegetarian</h3>
    <article>
      A Muslim can be a very good Muslim despite being a pure vegetarian. It is
      not compulsory for a Muslim to have non-vegetarian food.
    </article>
    <h3>Qur’an permits Muslims to have non-vegetarian food</h3>
    <article>
      The Qur’an, however permits a Muslim to have non-vegetarian food. The
      following Qur’anic verses are proof of this fact: <br />
      <em
        >“O ye who believe! Fulfill (all) obligations. Lawful unto you (for
        food) are all four-footed animals with the exceptions named…”</em
      >[Al-Qur’an 5:1] <br /><br />
      <em
        >“And cattle He has created for you (men): from them ye derive warmth,
        and numerous benefits, and of their (meat) ye eat.”</em
      >[Al-Qur’an 16:5] <br /><br />
      <em
        >“And in cattle (too) ye have an instructive example: From within their
        bodies We produce (milk) for you to drink; there are, in them,
        (besides), numerous (other) benefits for you; and of their (meat) ye
        eat.”</em
      >
      [Al-Qur’an 23:21]
    </article>
    <h3>Meat is nutritious and rich in complete protein</h3>
    <article>
      Non-vegetarian food is a good source of excellent protein. It contains
      biologically complete protein i.e. all the 8 essential amino acids that
      are not synthesized by the body and should be supplied in the diet. Meat
      also contains iron, vitamin B1 and niacin.
    </article>
    <h3>Humans have Omnivorous set of teeth</h3>
    <article>
      If you observe the teeth of herbivorous animals like the cow, goat and
      sheep, you will find something strikingly similar in all of them. All
      these animals have a set of flat teeth i.e. suited for herbivorous diet.
      If you observe the set of teeth of the carnivorous animals like the lion,
      tiger, or leopard, they all have a set of pointed teeth i.e. suited for a
      carnivorous diet. If you analyze the set of teeth of humans, you find that
      they have flat teeth as well as pointed teeth. Thus they have teeth suited
      for both herbivorous as well as carnivorous food i.e. they are omnivorous.
      One may ask, if Almighty God wanted humans to have only vegetables, why
      did He provide us also with pointed teeth? It is logical that He expected
      us to need and to have both vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian food.
    </article>
    <h3>Human beings can digest both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food</h3>
    <article>
      The digestive system of herbivorous animals can digest only vegetables.
      The digestive system of carnivorous animals can digest only non-vegetarian
      food. But the digestive system of humans can digest both vegetarian and
      nonvegetarian food. If Almighty God wanted us to have only vegetables then
      why did He give us a digestive system that can digest both vegetarian as
      well as non-vegetarian food?
    </article>
    <h3>Hindu scriptures give permission to have non-vegetarian food</h3>
    <article>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          There are many Hindus who are strictly vegetarian. They think it is
          against their religion to consume non-vegetarian food. As a matter of
          fact the Hindu scriptures permit a person to have non-vegetarian food.
          The scriptures mention Hindu sages and saints consuming non-vegetarian
          food.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is mentioned in Manusmriti, the Law Book of Hindus, in Chapter 5
          Verse 30 <br /><br />
          <em
            >“The eater who eats the flesh of those to be eaten does nothing
            bad, even if he does it day after day, for God himself created some
            to be eaten and some to be eater.”</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Again next verse of Manusmriti, that is, Chapter 5 Verse 31 says
          <br /><br />
          <em
            >“Eating meat is right for the sacrifice, this is traditionally
            known as a rule of the gods.”</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Further in Manusmriti Chapter 5 Verse 39 and 40 says <br /><br />
          <em
            >“God himself created sacrificial animals for sacrifice, ...,
            therefore killing in a sacrifice is not killing.”</em
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          . Mahabharata Anushashan Parva Chapter 88 narrates the discussion
          between Dharmaraj Yudhishthira and Bhishma Pitamah about what food one
          should offer to Pitris (ancestors) during the Shraddha (ceremony of
          dead) to keep them satisfied. Paragraph reads as follows:
          <br /><br />
          “Yudhishthira said, “O thou of great puissance, tell me what that
          object is which, if dedicated to the Pitris (dead ancestors), become
          inexhaustible! What Havi, again, (if offered) lasts for all time?
          What, indeed, is that which (if presented) becomes eternal?”
          <br /><br />
          “Bhishma said, “Listen to me, O Yudhishthira, what those Havis are
          which persons conversant with the rituals of the Shraddha (the
          ceremony of dead) regard as suitable in view of Shraddha and what the
          fruits are that attach to each. With sesame seeds and rice and barley
          and Masha and water and roots and fruits, if given at Shraddhas, the
          pitris, O king, remain gratified for the period of a month. With
          fishes offered at Shraddhas, the pitris remain gratified for a period
          of two months. With the mutton they remain gratified for three months
          and with the hare for four months, with the flesh of the goat for five
          months, with the bacon (meat of pig) for six months, and with the
          flesh of birds for seven. With venison obtained from those deer that
          are called Prishata, they remain gratified for eight months, and with
          that obtained from the Ruru for nine months, and with the meat of
          Gavaya for ten months, With the meat of the bufffalo their
          gratification lasts for eleven months. With beef presented at the
          Shraddha, their gratification, it is said, lasts for a full year.
          Payasa mixed with ghee is as much acceptable to the pitris as beef.
          With the meat of Vadhrinasa (a large bull) the gratification of pitris
          lasts for twelve years. The flesh of rhinoceros, offered to the pitris
          on anniversaries of the lunar days on which they died, becomes
          inexhaustible. The potherb called Kalaska, the petals of kanchana
          flower, and meat of (red) goat also, thus offered, prove
          inexhaustible.” <br /><br />
          So but natural if you want to keep your ancestors satisfied forever,
          you should serve them the meat of red goat.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s mentioned in Ayodhya Khanda, Book 2, Chapter 20, Verse 29 when
          Rama was sent to exile to a forest for 14 years, Kaushalya, his mother
          asked him to take food. So he said to his mother: <br /><br />
          “I shall live in a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years
          leaving off meat and living with roots, fruits and honey”.
          <br /><br />It means that Rama had meat. If Rama can have meat then
          why can’t the Hindus have meat?

    <h3>Hinduism was influenced by other religions</h3>
    <article>
      Though Hindu Scriptures permit its followers to have non-vegetarian food,
      many Hindus adopted the vegetarian system because they were influenced by
      other religions like Jainism etc.
    </article>
    <h3>Even plants have life</h3>
    <article>
      Certain religions have adopted pure vegetarianism as a dietary law because
      they are totally against the killing of living creatures. If a person can
      survive without killing any living creature, I would be the first person
      to adopt such a way of life. In the past people thought plants were
      lifeless. Today it is a universal fact that even plants have life. Thus
      their logic of not killing living creatures is not fulfilled even by being
      a pure vegetarian.
    </article>
    <h3>Even plants can feel pain</h3>
    <article>
      They further argue that plants cannot feel pain, therefore killing a plant
      is a lesser crime as compared to killing an animal. Today science tells us
      that even plants can feel pain. But the cry of the plant cannot be heard
      by the human being. This is due to the inability of the human ear to only
      hear sounds that are not in the audible range i.e. 20 Hertz to 20,000
      Hertz. Anything below and above this range cannot be heard by a human
      being. A dog can hear up to 40,000 Hertz. Thus there are silent dog
      whistles that have a frequency of more than 20,000 Hertz and less than
      40,000 Hertz. These whistles are only heard by dogs and not by human
      beings. The dog recognizes the master’s whistle and comes to the master.
      There was a research done by a farmer in USA who invented an instrument
      which converted the cry of the plant so that it could be heard by human
      beings. He was able to realize immediately when the plant itself cried for
      water. Latest researches show that the plants can even feel happy and sad.
      It can also cry!
    </article>
    <h3>
      Killing a living creature with two senses less is not a lesser crime
    </h3>
    <article>
      Once a vegetarian argued his case by saying that plants only have two or
      three senses while the animals have five senses. Therefore killing a plant
      is a lesser crime than killing an animal. Suppose your brother is born
      deaf and mute and has two senses less as compared to other human beings.
      He becomes mature and someone murders him. Would you ask the judge to give
      the murderer a lesser punishment because your brother had two senses less?
      Infact you would say that he has killed a masoom, an innocent person, and
      the judge should give the murderer a greater punishment.
      <br /><br />
      The Qur’an says in Surah Al Baqarah Chapter 2 Verse 168:
      <br /><br />
      <em>“O ye people! Eat of what is on earth, lawful and good…” </em
      >[Al-Qur’an 2:168]
    </article>
    <h3>Over population of cattle</h3>
    <article>
      If every human being was a vegetarian, it would lead to overpopulation of
      cattle in the world, since their reproduction and multiplication is very
      swift. Allah (swt) in His Divine Wisdom knows how to maintain the balance
      of His creation appropriately. No wonder He has permitted us to have the
      meat of the cattle.
    </article>
    <h3>Cost of meat is reasonable since all aren’t non-vegetarians</h3>
    <article>
      I do not mind if some people are pure vegetarians. However they should not
      condemn non-vegetarians as ruthless. Infact if all Indians become
      nonvegetarians then the present non-vegetarians would be losers since the
      prices of meat would rise.
