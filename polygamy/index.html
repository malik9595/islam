    <h3>Definition of Polygamy</h3>
    <article>
      Polygamy means a system of marriage whereby a person has more than one
      spouse. Polygamy can be of two types. One is polygyny where a man marries
      more than one woman, and the other is polyandry, where a woman marries
      more than one man. In Islam, limited polygyny is permitted; whereas
      polyandry is completely prohibited.

      The Qur’an is the only religious scripture in the world that says, ‘Marry
      Only One.’
    </h3>
    <article>
      The Qur’an is the only religious book, on the face of this earth, that
      contains the phrase ‘Marry Only One’. There is no other religious book
      that instructs men to have only one wife. In none of the other religious
      scriptures, whether it be the Vedas, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the
      Geeta, the Talmud or the Bible does one find a restriction on the number
      of wives. According to these scriptures one can marry as many as one
      wishes. It was only later, that the Hindu priests and the Christian Church
      restricted the number of wives to one. <br />
      Many Hindu religious personalities, according to their scriptures, had
      multiple wives. King Dashrat, the father of Rama, had more than one wife.
      Krishna had 16,108 wives. Some Hindus may argue that Krishna did not marry
      these women for sex but to give them protection. After the battle
      thousands of women became widows and Krishna, in order to give them
      protection married them. Then, how come Krishna had 160,000 children from
      them. <br />
      In earlier times, Christian men were permitted as many wives as they
      wished, since the Bible puts no restriction on the number of wives. It was
      only a few centuries ago that the Church restricted the number of wives to
      one. <br />
      Polygyny is permitted in Judaism. According to the Talmudic law, Abraham
      had three wives, and Solomon had seven hundred wives. The practice of
      polygyny continued till Rabbi Gershom ben Yehudah (960 CE to 1030 CE)
      issued an edict against it. The Jewish Sephardic communities living in
      Muslim countries continued the practice till as late as 1950, until an Act
      of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel extended the ban on marrying more than
      one wife.

    <h3>Hindus are more polygynous than Muslims</h3>
    <article>
      The report of the ‘Committee of The Status of Women in Islam’, published
      in 1975 mentions on page numbers 66 and 67 that the percentage of
      polygamous marriages between the years 1951 and 1961 was 5.06% among the
      Hindus and only 4.31% among the Muslims. According to Indian law only
      Muslim men are permitted to have more than one wife. It is illegal for any
      non-Muslim in India to have more than one wife. Despite it being illegal,
      Hindus have more multiple wives as compared to Muslims. Earlier, there was
      no restriction even on Hindu men with respect to the number of wives
      allowed. It was only in 1954, when the Hindu Marriage Act was passed that
      it became illegal for a Hindu to have more than one wife. At present it is
      the Indian Law that restricts a Hindu man from having more than one wife
      and not the Hindu scriptures. <br />
      Let us now analyse why Islam allows a man to have more than one wife.

    <h3>Qur’an permits limited polygyny</h3>
    <article>
      As I mentioned earlier, Qur’an is the only religious book on the face of
      the earth that says ‘Marry Only One’. The context of this phrase is the
      following verse from Surah Al Nisaa’ of the Glorious Qur’an: <br />
      <em>
        “Marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that
        ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one…”
        [Al-Qur’an 4:3</em
      >
      <br />
      Before the Qur’an was revealed, there was no upper limit for polygyny and
      many men had scores of wives, some even hundreds. Islam put an upper limit
      of four wives. Islam gives a man permission to marry two, three or four
      women, only on the condition that he deals justly with them. <br />
      <em
        >“Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is
        your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether, so as
        to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly
        understanding, and practise self-restraint, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most
        Merciful.” [Al-Qur’an 4:129]
      </em>
      <br />
      Therefore polygyny is not a rule but an exception. Many people are under
      the misconception that it is compulsory for a Muslim man to have more than
      one wife. <br />
      Broadly, Islam has five categories of Do’s and Don’ts:
      <ol>
        <li>‘Fard’ i.e. compulsory or obligatory</li>
        <li>‘Mustahab’ i.e. recommended or encouraged</li>
        <li>‘Mubah’ i.e. permissible or allowed</li>
        <li>‘Makruh’ i.e. not recommended or discouraged</li>
        <li>‘Haraam’ i.e. prohibited or forbidden</li>
      </ol>
      Polygyny falls in the middle category of things that are permissible. It
      cannot be said that a Muslim who has two, three or four wives is a better
      Muslim as compared to a Muslim who has only one wife.

    <h3>Average life span of females is more than that of males</h3>
    <article>
      By nature males and females are born in approximately the same ratio. A
      female child has more immunity than a male child. A female child can fight
      the germs and diseases better than the male child. For this reason, during
      the paediatric age itself there are more deaths among males as compared to
      the females.
      <br />
      During wars, there are more men killed as compared to women. More men die
      due to accidents and diseases than women. The average life span of females
      is more than that of males, and at any given time one finds more widows in
      the world than widowers.

    <h3>
      India has more male population than female due to female foeticide and
      infanticide
    </h3>
    <article>
      India is one of the few countries, along with the other neighbouring
      countries, in which the female population is less than the male
      population. The reason lies in the high rate of female foeticide and
      female infanticide in India. “Daily around 7000 girls are killed in the
      womb or immediately after birth in India” – UN Report, Quoted in Al
      Jazeera, 6th July 2015. If you multiply this figure by 365, the number of
      days in a year you will get more than 2.5 million females being aborted or
      killed immediately after birth every year in India.
      <br />
      If this evil practice is stopped, then India too will have more females as
      compared to males.
    </article>
    <h3>World female population is more than male population </h3>
    <article>
        According to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) The World Factbook, in July 2015, in the USA, women outnumbered men by 4.8 million. New York alone has 0.5 million more females as compared to the number of males. Germany has more than 1.2 million more females as compared to males. Bangladesh has more than 4.2 million females as compared to males. Russia has more than 10 million females as compared to males. The European Union, which constitutes 28 Countries of Europe, has more than 10.2 million females as compared to males. 
    </article>
    <h3>Restricting each and every man to have only one wife is not practical </h3>
    <article>
        Even if every man got married to one woman, there would still be more than 4.8 million females in USA who would not be able to get husbands. There would be more than 1.2 million females in Germany, more than 4.2 million females in Bangladesh, more than 10 million females in Russia, more than 10.2 million females in the European Union alone, who would not be able to find a husband. 
 <br>
        Suppose my sister happens to be one of the unmarried women living in USA, or suppose your sister happens to be one of the unmarried women in USA. The only two options remaining for her are that she either marries a man who already has a wife or becomes a public property. There is no other option. All those who are modest will opt for the first.  
        <br>
        In Western society, it is common for a man to have mistresses and/or multiple extra-marital affairs, in which case, the woman leads a disgraceful, unprotected life. The same society, however, cannot accept a man having more than one wife, in which women retain their honourable, dignified position in society and lead a protected life.  
       <br>
       Thus the only two options before a woman who cannot find a husband is to marry a married man or to become public property. Islam prefers giving women the honourable position by permitting the first option and disallowing the second. 
    </article>
    <h3>Other Reasons for Polygyny being permitted </h3>
    <article>Excess of women is not the only reason why a man is allowed to marry more than one woman. There are several other reasons besides this. </article>
    <h3>
        WIFE IS STERILE: COUPLE HAS NO CHILDREN 
    </h3>
    <article>
        Suppose the wife is sterile or barren and the couple is unable to have children for several years. Islam does not permit legal adoption (for which there are several reasons). But may be the husband and wife both desire children and the wife does not mind sharing her husband. So what’s the harm in a man having two wives as long as he deals with them justly. Even if the wife may not desire to have a child and the husband wishes to continue his progeny, 
then the only option remaining for him is to either divorce his first wife and take another wife or keep the first wife and marry a second and treat both the wives with justice and equality.  

    </article>
    <h3>
        WIFE MAY MEET WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BECOME HANDICAP 
    </h3>
    <article>
        Suppose a young girl within a few months of her marriage meets with an accident and gets handicapped, after which she is unable to perform her duty as a wife. The only option for the young husband is that he either divorces his first wife and takes another wife or keeps the first wife and marries another woman and treats both the wives with justice and equality. 
    </article>
    <h3>
        WIFE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE ILLNESS OR DISEASE  
    </h3>
    <article>
        Suppose a wife suffers from a severe illness or disease, and is unable to look after her young children and satisfy her husband. The first option you can find here is that the husband keeps the first wife and takes the second wife. This wife will act as a help and support to the first wife and her children. Many may argue that you can always keep a full-time nurse or a maid-servant for this purpose. I do agree that this full-time nurse or maid-servant will surely support the wife and the children, but very soon will also start “supporting” the young husband. Therefore the only modest option is to keep the first wife and take the second wife and treat them equally with justice. <br>
        There are several other reasons, why Islam has permitted limited polygyny, but it is mainly to protect the modesty of women.
