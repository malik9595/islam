    <h3>Major difference between Islam and other religions</h3>
    <article>
      All religions basically teach its followers to do good deeds, but the
      difference between Islam and other religions is that Islam shows us the
      way how to achieve that state of goodness.

      Example - Islam does not only prohibit robbery but also prescribes methods
      of eliminating robbery
    </h3>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <strong> Islam prescribes a method of eliminating robbery</strong
          ><br />
          All major religions teach that robbing is an evil act. Islam teaches
          the same. So what is the difference between Islam and the other
          religions? The difference lies in the fact that Islam, besides
          teaching that robbing is evil, shows a practical way on how to achieve
          that state in which people will not rob.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Islam prescribes Zakaah</strong><br />
          Islam prescribes a system of Zakaah (obligatory annual charity).
          Islamic law prescribes that every rich person who has a saving of more
          than the nisaab level i.e. more than 85 grams of gold, should give
          2.5% of that saving every lunar year in charity. If every rich person
          in the world gives Zakaah sincerely, poverty will be eradicated from
          this world. Not a single human being would die of hunger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chopping off the hands as punishment for robbery</strong
          ><br />
          Islam prescribes chopping off the hands for the robber. The Glorious
          Qur’an says in Surah Al Maa’idah:
          <br />
          <em>
            “As to the thief, male or female, cut off his or her hands: a
            punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah
            is Exalted in power, full of wisdom.”
          </em>
          &nbsp;[Al-Qur’an 5:38] <br /><br />
          The non-Muslim may say, “Chopping off the hands in this 21st century.
          Islam is a barbaric and ruthless religion!”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Results achieved when Islamic Shar’iah is Implemented</strong
          ><br />
          America is supposed to be one of the most advanced countries in the
          world. Unfortunately it also has one of the highest rates of crime,
          theft, and robbery.
          <br /><br />
          According to National Crime Victimization Survey Bureau of Justice
          Statistics (US Dept. of Justice), in the year 2014 alone 664,210 cases
          of robbery took place in America. Everyday 1,820 cases of Robbery.
          Every Second 1.26 cases of robbery took place in America in the year
          2014.
          <br /><br />
          According to National Crime Victimization Survey Bureau of Justice
          Statistics (US Dept. of Justice), in 2013 alone 6,126,420 Violent
          Crimes took place in America. Everyday 16,785 cases of Violent Crime.
          Every second about 12 Violent Crimes were committed in America in the
          year 2013.
          <br /><br />
          Suppose the Islamic Shar’iah is implemented in America i.e. every rich
          person gives Zakaat (i.e. 2.5% of his savings in charity above 85
          grams of gold every lunar year), and every convicted robber has his or
          her hands chopped off as a punishment. Will the rate of theft and
          robbery in America increase, remain same or decrease? Naturally it
          will decrease. It’s a practical law. The moment the Shar’iah is
          implemented, it gets results.
          <br /><br />
          I agree that the amount of theft that takes place in the world today
          is so tremendous that if you chop off the hands of all the thieves,
          there will be tens of thousands of people whose hands will be chopped
          off. The point here is that the moment you implement this law, the
          rate of theft will decline immediately. The robber will think 10 times
          before robbing. The mere thought of the punishment itself will
          discourage majority of the robbers. There will barely be a few who
          would rob. Hence only a few person’s hands would be chopped off but
          millions would live peacefully without fear of being robbed.
          <br /><br />
          Islamic Shar’iah is therefore practical, and achieves results.

      Example - Islam prohibits the molestation and rape of women. It enjoins
      Hijaab and prescribes capital punishment for a rapist
    </h3>
    <article>

        <li>
          <strong>
            Islam prescribes methods of eliminating molestation and rape</strong
          ><br />
          All the major religions teach its followers not to molest or rape
          women. Islam teaches the same. What then is the difference between
          Islam and the other religions? The difference lies in the fact that
          Islam does not merely prohibit but also shows a way about how to
          achieve a state in which people will not molest or rape women.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hijaab for men</strong><br />
          Islam has a system of Hijaab. The Glorious Qur’an first mentions
          Hijaab for the men and then for the women. Hijaab for the men is
          mentioned in the following verse: <br /><br />
          <em
            >“Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and
            guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: and
            Allah is well acquainted with all that they do.”
          </em>
          &nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 24:30] <br /><br />
          The moment a man looks at a woman and if any brazen or unashamed
          thought comes to his mind, he should lower his gaze.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hijaab for women</strong> <br />
          Hijaab for women is mentioned in the following verse:
          <br /><br />
          <em
            >“And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze
            and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty
            and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that
            they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their
            beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands’
            fathers, their sons...”</em
          >
          &nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 24:31] <br /><br />
          The extent of Hijaab for a woman is that her complete body should be
          covered. The only part that can be seen, are the face and the hands up
          to the wrists. If they wish to cover, they can even cover these parts
          of the body. However some Islamic scholars insist that even the face
          should be covered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hijaab prevents molestation</strong> <br />
          The reason why Allah has prescribed Hijaab for the women is given in
          the Qur’an in the following verse of Surah Al-Ahzaab:
          <br /><br />
          <em
            >“O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women,
            that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when
            abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as
            such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most
            Merciful.”</em
          >
          &nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 33:59] <br /><br />
          The Qur’an says that Hijaab has been prescribed for the women so that
          they are recognized as modest women, and this would prevent them from
          being molested.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Example of twin sisters</strong> <br />
          Suppose two sisters who are twins and who are equally beautiful, walk
          down a street. One of them is wearing the Islamic Hijaab i.e. the
          complete body is covered except for the face and the hands up to the
          wrists, and the other twin is wearing a mini skirt or shorts with a
          deep neck. Around the corner there is a hooligan who is waiting for an
          opportunity to tease a girl. Who will he tease? The girl wearing the
          Islamic Hijaab or the girl wearing the mini skirt or shorts with a
          deep neck? Dresses that expose more than they conceal, are an indirect
          invitation to the opposite sex for teasing, molestation and rape. The
          Qur’an rightly says that the Hijaab prevents women from being
          molested.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Capital punishment for rapist</strong><br />
          The Islamic Shar’iah prescribes capital punishment for a rapist. The
          non-Muslim may say, “Capital punishment in the age of science and
          technology! Islam is a ruthless and barbaric religion.” Many accuse
          Islam of being ruthless and barbaric. I have asked a common question
          to hundreds of non-Muslim men. Suppose God-forbid, some one rapes your
          wife, your mother or your sister and you are made the judge. The
          rapist is brought in front of you. What punishment would you give him?
          All of them said, “we would put him to death”. Some went to the extent
          of saying, “we would torture him to death”. If your wife or your
          mother is raped you want the rapist to be put to death. But if someone
          else’s wife or mother is raped, capital punishment is a barbaric law.
          Why the double standards?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>USA has one of the highest rates of Rape</strong><br />
          The United States of America is supposed to be one of the most
          advanced countries of the world. An FBI report in the year 1990 says
          that 1,02,555 cases of rape were reported. It further says that only
          16% of the cases of rapes were reported. Thus, in order to know the
          actual number of rapes that took place in 1990, the reported figure
          should be multiplied by 6.25. We get a total of 6,40,968 rape cases
          that took place in the year 1990. If the total is divided by 365, the
          number of days in a year, we get an average of 1,756 rape incidents
          everyday.
          <br /><br />
          The FBI report of 1990 continues and says that out of the rape cases
          that were reported only 10% of the rapists were arrested, that is only
          1.6% of the actual rapes committed. Out of those arrested, 50% were
          let free before the trial. This would mean that only 0.8% of the
          rapists faced a trial. In other words if a person commits 125 rapes
          the chances that he will get a punishment for rape is only once. Many
          would consider this a good gamble. And the report says that of those
          people who faced trial, 50% received sentences of less than a year’s
          imprisonment though the American law says rape carries a seven-year
          sentence of imprisonment. For a rapist, the judge is lenient to first
          time offenders. Imagine a person commits 125 rapes and the chances of
          being convicted is only once, and 50% of the time the judge will be
          lenient and give a sentence of less than a year!
          <br /><br />
          According to National Crime Victimization Survey Bureau of Justice
          Statistics (US Dept. of Justice), in 2014 alone 2,84,350 cases of rape
          were reported and only 33.6% of the actual cases of rape were
          reported. Thus, 2,84,350 X 2.976 = 8,46,280 rapes took place in 2014.
          That is, an average of 2,318 cases of rape took place everyday in
          America in 2014. Every 37 seconds one rape is taking place in America.
          Maybe American rapists got bolder.
        </li>

          <strong>Results achieved when Islamic Shar’iah is implemented</strong
          ><br />
          Suppose the Islamic Shar’iah is implemented in America. Whenever a man
          looks at a woman and if any brazen or unashamed thought comes to his
          mind, he lowers his gaze. Every woman wears the Islamic Hijaab that is
          the complete body is covered except the face and the hands upto the
          wrists. After this if any man commits rape, he gets capital
          punishment. The question is, will the rate of rape in America
          increase, will it remain the same or will it decrease? Naturally it
          will decrease. Islamic Shar’iah gets results.
