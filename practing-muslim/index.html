    <h1>
      If Islam is the best religion, why are many of the Muslims dishonest,
      unreliable, and involved in activities such as cheating, bribing, dealing
      in drugs, etc.?
    </h1>
    <h3>Media maligns Islam</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Islam is without doubt the best religion but the media is in the hands
        of the westerners who are afraid of Islam. The media is continuously
        broadcasting and printing information against Islam. They either provide
        misinformation about Islam, misquote Islam or project a point out of
        proportion, if any.
      </li>
      <li>
        When any bomb blasts take place anywhere, the first people to be accused
        without proof are invariably the Muslims. This appears as headlines in
        the news. Later, when they find that non-Muslims were responsible, it
        appears as an insignificant news item.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a 50-year old Muslim marries a 15-year old girl after taking her
        permission, it appears on the front page but when a 50-year old
        nonMuslim rapes a 6-year old girl, it may appear in the news in the
        inside pages as ‘Newsbriefs’. Everyday in America on an average 2,318
        cases of rape take place but it doesn’t appear in the news, since it has
        become a way of life for the Americans.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Black sheep in every community</h3>
    <article>
      I am aware that there are some Muslims who are dishonest, unreliable, who
      cheat, etc. but the media projects this as though only Muslims are
      involved in such activities. There are black sheep in every community. I
      know Muslims who are alcoholics and who can drink most of the non-Muslims
      under the table.

    <h3>Muslims best as a whole</h3>
    <article>
      Inspite of all the black sheep in the Muslim community, Muslims taken on
      the whole, yet form the best community in the world. We are the biggest
      community of tee totallers as a whole, i.e. those who don’t imbibe
      alcohol. Collectively, we are a community, which gives the maximum charity
      in the world. There is not a single person in the world who can even show
      a candle to the Muslims where modesty is concerned; where sobriety is
      concerned; where human values and ethics are concerned.

    <h3> Don’t judge a car by its driver</h3>
    <article>Suppose if you want to judge how good is the latest model of the “Mercedes”
        car and a person who does not know how to drive sits at the steering wheel
        and bangs up the car, who will you blame? The car or the driver? But
        naturally, the driver. To analyze how good the car is, a person should not look
        at the driver but see the ability and features of the car. How fast is it, what is
        its average fuel consumption, what are the safety measures, etc. Even if I
        agree for the sake of argument that the Muslims are bad, we can’t judge
        Islam by its followers? If you want to judge how good Islam is, then judge it
        according to its authentic sources, i.e. the Glorious Qur’an and the Sahih
        Hadith.</article>
        <h3>Judge Islam by its best follower i.e. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)</h3>
        <article>
            If you practically want to check how good a car is, put an expert driver behind
the steering wheel. Similarly the best and the most exemplary follower of
Islam by whom you can check how good Islam is, is the last and final
messenger of God, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Besides Muslims, there are
several honest and unbiased non-Muslim historians who have acclaimed that
prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was the best human being. According to Michael
H. Hart who wrote the book, ‘The 100 Most Influential Men in History’, the
topmost position, i.e. the number one position goes to the beloved prophet of
Islam, Muhammad (pbuh). There are several such examples of non-Muslims
paying great tributes to the Prophet (pbuh), like Thomas Carlyle, La-Martine,
etc.
