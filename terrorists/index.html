    <h1>Why are most of the Muslims Terrorists?</h1>
    <article>
      The common misconception is ‘Muslims are Terrorists.’ And after 9/11, you
      had the 7th July or 7/7, that’s the London Bombing and there was a common
      statement, which said, “All Muslims are not Terrorists but All Terrorists
      are Muslims”

    <h3>Meaning of the word ‘Terrorist’</h3>
    <article>
      What is the meaning of the word ‘Terrorist’? ‘Terrorist’ by definition
      means a person who causes terror. For example if a criminal sees a
      policeman, he is terrified. So for the criminal, the policeman is a
      terrorist. I’m aware that ‘Terrorist’ more commonly means a person who
      terrorizes innocent human beings.

    <h3>
      Two different labels given to the same individual for the same action
    </h3>
    <article>
      We know from the Media that many a time two different labels are given to
      the same individual for his same activity. For example, more than 60 years
      back there were many Indians who were fighting for the freedom of the
      country. These people by the British Government were called as
      ‘Terrorists’. But we common Indians, we call these people as ‘Freedom
      Fighters’, as ‘Patriots’; same people, same activity, but two different
      labels. If you agree with the view of the British Government that they had
      a right to rule over India, then you have to call these people as
      ‘Terrorists’. But if you agree with the view of the common Indians that
      the Britishers came to India to do business, they had no right to rule
      over us then you have to call these people as Patriots or Freedom
      Fighters. Same people, same activity, but two different labels.

        ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and afterwards
        become full of repentance for what ye have done.”</em

    <h3>George Washington</h3>
    <article>
      When the Britishers were ruling America, during the American Revolution in
      1775, George Washington was called as the ‘Terrorist No. 1’ by the British
      Government. Later on when America gets its freedom, George Washington is
      made the President of USA. Imagine ‘Terrorist No. 1’ becomes the President
      of USA.

    <h3>Nelson Mandela</h3>
    <article>
      We have the example of Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela several decades
      earlier when the White Apartheid Government ruled South Africa, was
      arrested and imprisoned in Robin Islands for more than 25 years. The White
      Apartheid Government called Nelson Mandela as ‘Terrorist No. 1’. Later on
      when South Africa gets its freedom and the White Apartheid Government is
      removed, Nelson Mandela is given freedom and he gets the ‘Noble Prize for
      Peace’. Imagine ‘Terrorist No. 1’ of the world gets the ‘Noble Prize for
      Peace’! Not that he was bad and then he became good, but for the same
      activity for which he was called a Terrorist, 30 years later he gets the
      ‘Noble Prize for Peace’!

    <h3>Powerful Media dictates Idea</h3>
    <article>
      We realize whoever is in power, whatever the label that person gives, it
      gets stuck on to that person. This is Media. Media is very powerful.
      According to me it is the most important weapon today. It can convert
      black into white, day into night, hero into a villain, villain into a
      hero, this is Media. Unfortunately we Muslims are very backward as far as
      Media is concerned. Whatever technology is Halaal, what is permitted in
      Qur’an and Sunnah we have to use it. Televison per se is not Haraam. We
      have to convert it to Halaal. In future do not believe blindly whatever
      the Media says. Please check it, confirm it and only after verification
      believe in it. Hence, it is very important that before one gives any label
      to any person, one should critically analyse the situation, the reason for
      the activity and the intention of the person.
