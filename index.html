  <h1>What is Islam?</h1>
  <p>Islam is a monotheistic religion founded on the belief in one God, Allah, and based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It is one of the Abrahamic faiths, alongside Judaism and Christianity. The core religious text of Islam is the <strong>Qur'an</strong>, which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a period of 23 years. Islam emphasizes submission to Allahâ€™s will, and the practice of the Five Pillars of Islam, which are:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shahada</strong> (Faith): The declaration that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet.</li>
    <li><strong>Salah</strong> (Prayer): Performing ritual prayers five times a day.</li>
    <li><strong>Zakat</strong> (Charity): Giving a portion of one's wealth to help those in need.</li>
    <li><strong>Sawm</strong> (Fasting): Observing fasting during the month of Ramadan.</li>
    <li><strong>Hajj</strong> (Pilgrimage): Making a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once in a lifetime if able.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Islam teaches peace, justice, mercy, and compassion, and it guides followers on how to live a righteous and ethical life.</p>

  <h1>Who is a Muslim?</h1>
  <p>A <strong>Muslim</strong> is a person who follows the religion of Islam. The term "Muslim" means "one who submits" (to the will of God). A Muslim believes in the oneness of God (Allah) and follows the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad). Muslims practice the Five Pillars of Islam and strive to live a life in accordance with the teachings of Islam. Muslims can be found all over the world and belong to a variety of cultures and traditions, but they are united by their faith in Allah and the teachings of Islam.</p>
