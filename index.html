  <h1>What is Islam?</h1>
  <article>Islam is a monotheistic religion founded on the belief in one God, Allah, and based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It is one of the Abrahamic faiths, alongside Judaism and Christianity. The core religious text of Islam is the <strong>Qur'an</strong>, which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad over a period of 23 years. Islam emphasizes submission to Allah’s will, and the practice of the Five Pillars of Islam, which are:</article>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shahada</strong> (Faith): The declaration that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet.</li>
    <li><strong>Salah</strong> (Prayer): Performing ritual prayers five times a day.</li>
    <li><strong>Zakat</strong> (Charity): Giving a portion of one's wealth to help those in need.</li>
    <li><strong>Sawm</strong> (Fasting): Observing fasting during the month of Ramadan.</li>
    <li><strong>Hajj</strong> (Pilgrimage): Making a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once in a lifetime if able.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Islam teaches peace, justice, mercy, and compassion, and it guides followers on how to live a righteous and ethical life.</p>

  <h1>Who is a Muslim?</h1>
  <article>A <strong>Muslim</strong> is a person who follows the religion of Islam. The term "Muslim" means "one who submits" (to the will of God). A Muslim believes in the oneness of God (Allah) and follows the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad). Muslims practice the Five Pillars of Islam and strive to live a life in accordance with the teachings of Islam. Muslims can be found all over the world and belong to a variety of cultures and traditions, but they are united by their faith in Allah and the teachings of Islam.</article>

  <h1>Who is Muhammad?</h1>
  <article>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final messenger of Allah, as confirmed in the Quran and Hadith. He was sent as a mercy to all creation and a guide for humanity, tasked with conveying the divine revelation of the Quran. Described as the "Seal of the Prophets" (Quran 33:40), his mission was to teach faith, righteousness, and submission to Allah. The Quran praises his noble character, calling him a role model for those who seek closeness to Allah and hope for the Hereafter (Quran 33:21). 
<br> <br>
    Authentic Hadith further emphasize his unique status as the greatest of creation and the intercessor for humanity on the Day of Judgment. He described himself as the final "brick" completing the structure of prophethood, highlighting the finality of his role (Sahih al-Bukhari). His teachings, preserved in his Sunnah, provide guidance for all aspects of life, ensuring that those who adhere to them along with the Quran will never go astray.
    <br><br>
    Known for his compassion and mercy, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) demonstrated unmatched kindness in his dealings with others, emphasizing forgiveness and empathy. He declared, "I was not sent to curse but as a mercy" (Sahih Muslim). Through his life and teachings, he exemplified moral excellence, serving as the perfect example for all believers to follow.

<article>
  The Quran is the holy scripture of Islam, believed to be the literal word of Allah revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) over 23 years. It serves as the ultimate source of guidance for humanity, encompassing spiritual, moral, legal, and social teachings. The Quran describes itself as a book of clarity and guidance:
<br> <br>
<strong>Quran 2:2:</strong><em> "This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah."</em> <br><br>
<strong>Quran 41:3:</strong><em>"A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Quran for a people who know." </em> 

 The Quran is also regarded as a miracle of eloquence, unmatched in its linguistic beauty and depth. Allah challenges humanity to produce even a single chapter like it, emphasizing its divine origin: <br><br>
<strong>Quran 2:23:</strong> <em> "And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful."</em>

<h3>Are men and women equal in Islam?</h3>
<article>
  In Islam, men and women are considered spiritually equal in the sight of Allah, as emphasized in the Quran and Hadith. They are granted equal access to rewards, responsibilities, and accountability based on their deeds, though their roles and obligations may differ in some aspects to complement one another. Dr. Zakir Naik also elaborates on this perspective, explaining that equality in Islam does not mean identical roles but rather fairness and justice based on individual capabilities and responsibilities.
  <br><br>
  Both men and women are equally accountable for their deeds and can attain spiritual success: <br>
<strong>Quran 33:35:</strong>
"Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women... Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward."
<br>
Gender is not a factor in earning Allah’s pleasure and rewards:
<br>
<strong>Quran 16:97:</strong>
"Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while being a believer – We will surely cause him to live a good life."
<br>
The Quran highlights complementary rights and responsibilities:
<br><strong>Quran 4:32:</strong>
"And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned."
