      Why do Muslims slaughter the animal in a ruthless manner by torturing it
      and slowly and painfully killing it?
    </h1>
    <article>
      The Islamic method of slaughtering animals, known as Zabiha has been the
      object of much criticism from a large number of people. <br /><br />
      Before I reply to the question, let me relate an incidence about a
      discussion between a Sikh and a Muslim regarding animal slaughter.
      <br /><br />
      Once a Sikh asked a Muslim, “Why do you slaughter the animal painfully by
      cutting the throat instead of the way we do with one stroke i.e. jhatka?”
      The Muslim replied “We are brave and courageous and attack from the front.
      We are mard ka baccha (macho men), you are cowards and attack from
      behind.”
      <br /><br />
      Jokes apart, one may consider the following points, which prove that the
      Zabiha method is not only humane but also scientifically the best:

    <h3>Islamic method of slaughtering animal</h3>
    <article>
        Zakkaytum is a verb derived from the root word Zakaah (to purify). Its
infinitive is Tazkiyah, which means purification. The Islamic mode of
slaughtering an animal requires the following conditions to be <br></br>
<ol type="a">
    <li> 
        <strong>Animal should be slaughtered with sharp object (knife):</strong><br>
        The animal has to be slaughtered with a sharp object (knife) and in a fast way
so that the pain of slaughter is minimised.
    </li>
    <li> 
        <strong>Cut windpipe, throat and vessels of neck:</strong> <br>
Zabiha is an Arabic word which means ‘slaughtered.’ The ‘slaughtering’ is to be
done by cutting the throat, windpipe and the blood vessels in the neck causing
the animal’s death without cutting the spinal cord.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Blood should be drained:</strong> <br>
        The blood has to be drained completely before the head is removed. The
purpose is to drain out most of the blood which would serve as a good culture
medium for micro-organisms. The spinal cord must not be cut because the
nerve fibres to the heart could be damaged during the process causing cardiac
arrest, stagnating the blood in the blood vessels.
    </li>
</ol>
    </article>
    <h3>Blood is a good medium for germs and bacteria</h3>
    <article>
        
        Blood is a good media of germs, bacteria, toxins, etc. Therefore the Muslim
        way of slaughtering is more hygienic as most of the blood containing germs,
        bacteria, toxins, etc. that are the cause of several diseases are eliminated.
    </article>
    <h3>Meat remains fresh for a longer time</h3>
    <article>    
Meat slaughtered by the Islamic way remains fresh for a longer time due to
deficiency of blood in the meat as compared to other methods of slaughtering.
    </article>
    <h3>  Animal does not feel pain</h3>
    <article>
The swift cutting of vessels of the neck disconnects the flow of blood to the
nerve of the brain responsible for pain. Thus the animal does not feel pain.
While dying, the animal struggles, writhes, shakes and kicks, not due to pain,
but due to the contraction and relaxation of the muscles deficient in blood and
due to the flow of blood out of the body.
