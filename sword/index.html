      How can Islam be called the religion of peace when it was spread by the
      sword?
    </h1>
    <article>
      It is a common complaint among some non-Muslims that Islam would not have
      millions of adherents all over the world, if it had not been spread by the
      use of force. The following points will make it clear, that far from being
      spread by the sword, it was the inherent force of truth, reason and logic
      that was responsible for the rapid spread of Islam.

    <h3>Islam means peace</h3>
    <article>
      Islam comes from the root word ‘salm’ or ‘salaam’, which means peace. It
      also derived from the root word ‘silm’, which means submitting one’s will
      to Allah (swt). Thus Islam is a religion of peace, which is acquired by
      submitting one’s will to the will of the Supreme Creator, Allah (swt).

    <h3>Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace</h3>
    <article>
      Each and every human being in this world is not in favour of maintaining
      peace and harmony. There are many, who would disrupt it for their own
      vested interests. Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace. It is
      precisely for this reason that we have the police who use force against
      criminals and anti-social elements to maintain peace in the country. Islam
      promotes peace. At the same time, Islam exhorts its followers to fight
      where there is oppression. The fight against oppression may, at times,
      require the use of force. In Islam, force can only be used to promote
      peace and justice.

    <h3>Opinion of historian De Lacy O’Leary</h3>
    <article>
      The best reply to the misconception that Islam was spread by the sword is
      given by the noted historian De Lacy O’Leary in the book “Islam at the
      Crossroads” (Page 8):
      <em
        >“History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims
        sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword
        upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myths that
        historians have ever repeated.”</em

    <h3>Muslims ruled Spain for 800 years</h3>
    <article>
      Muslims ruled Spain for about 800 years. The Muslims in Spain never used
      the sword to force the people to convert. Later the Christian Crusaders
      came to Spain and wiped out the Muslims. There was not a single Muslim in
      Spain who could openly give the adhaan that is the call for prayers.

    <h3>9 million Arabs are Coptic Christians</h3>
    <article>
      Muslims were the lords of Arabia for 1400 years. For a few years the
      British ruled, and for a few years the French ruled. Overall, the Muslims
      ruled Arabia for 1400 years. Yet today, there are 9 million Arabs who are
      Coptic Christians i.e. Christians since generations. If the Muslims had
      used the sword there would not have been a single Arab who would have
      remained a Christian.

    <h3>More than 80% non-Muslims in India</h3>
    <article>
      The Muslims ruled India for about a thousand years. If they wanted, they
      had the power of converting each and every non-Muslim of India to Islam.
      Today more than 80% of the population of India are non-Muslims. All these
      nonMuslim Indians are bearing witness today that Islam was not spread by
      the sword.

    <h3>Indonesia and Malaysia</h3>
    <article>
      Indonesia is a country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the
      world. The majority of people in Malaysia are Muslims. May one ask, “Which
      Muslim army went to Indonesia and Malaysia?”
    </article>
    <h3>East Coast of Africa</h3>
    <article>
      Similarly, Islam has spread rapidly on the East Coast of Africa. One may
      again ask, if Islam was spread by the sword, “Which Muslim army went to
      the East Coast of Africa?”
    </article>
    <h3>Thomas Carlyle</h3>
    <article>
      The famous historian, Thomas Carlyle, in his book “Heroes and Hero
      worship”, refers to this misconception about Islam being spread by the
      sword: “The sword indeed, but where will you get your sword? Every new
      opinion, at its starting is precisely in a minority of one. In one man’s
      head alone. There it dwells as yet. One man alone of the whole world
      believes it, there is one man against all men. That he takes a sword and
      tries to propagate with that, will do little for him. You must get your
      sword! On the whole, a thing will propagate itself as it can.”
    </article>
    <h3>No compulsion in religion</h3>
    <article>
      With which sword was Islam spread? Even if Muslims had it they could not
      use it to spread Islam because the Qur’an says in the following verse:
      <em
        >“Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from
        Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most
        trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth
        all things.”</em
      >[Al-Qur’an 2:256]
    </article>
    <h3>Sword of the Intellect</h3>

    <article>
      It is the sword of intellect. The sword that conquers the hearts and minds
      of people. The Qur’an says in Surah Al Nahl, Chapter 16 Verse 125:
      <em
        >“Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful
        preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most
        gracious...”
      </em>
      [Al-Qur’an 16:125]

    <h3>Increase in the world religions from 1934 to 1984</h3>
    <article>
      An article in Reader’s Digest ‘Almanac’, yearbook 1984, gave the
      statistics of the increase of percentage of the major religions of the
      world in half a century from 1934 to 1984. This article also appeared in
      ‘The Plain Truth’ magazine. At the top was Islam, which increased by 235%,
      and Christianity had increased only by 47%. May one ask, which war took
      place in the 20th century which converted millions of people to Islam?
    </article>
    <h3>Islam is the fastest growing religion in America and Europe.</h3>
    <article>
      Today the fastest growing religion in America is Islam. The fastest
      growing religion in Europe is Islam. Which sword is forcing people in the
      West to accept Islam in such large numbers? Today the Media is attacking
      Islam saying that it subjugates the women. Do you know, out of those
      accepting Islam in America and Europe, 2/3rd of them are women. If Islam
      subjugates the women, why are the American women, why are the European
      women accepting Islam? Who is forcing them?

    <h3>Dr Joseph Adam Pearson.</h3>
    <article>
      Dr Joseph Adam Pearson rightly says, “People who worry that nuclear
      weaponry will one day fall in the hands of the Arabs, fail to realize that
      the Islamic bomb (the bomb of Peace) has been dropped already, it fell the
      day MUHAMMAD (pbuh) was born.”
