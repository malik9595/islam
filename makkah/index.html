      Why are non-Muslims not allowed in the Holy cities of Makkah and Madinah?
    </h1>
    <article>
      It is true that non-Muslims are not allowed in the holy cities of Makkah
      and Madinah, by law. The following points will serve to elucidate the
      possible reasoning behind such a restriction.

    <h3>All citizens are not permitted in the cantonment area</h3>
    <article>
      I am a citizen of India. Yet, I am not permitted to enter certain
      restricted areas like the cantonment. In every country there are certain
      areas where a common citizen of that country cannot enter. Only a citizen
      who is enrolled in the military or those who are connected with the
      defence of the country are allowed in the cantonment area. Similarly Islam
      is a Universal Religion for the entire world and for all human beings. The
      cantonment areas of Islam are the two holy cites of Makkah and Madinah.
      Here, only those who believe in Islam and are involved in the defence of
      Islam i.e. the Muslims are allowed. <br /><br />
      It would be illogical for a common citizen who is not involved in
      defending the country, to object against the restriction on entering a
      cantonment area. Similarly it is not appropriate for non-Muslims to object
      against the restriction on non-Muslims entering Makkah and Madinah which
      are the cantonment areas of Islam.

    <h3>Visa to enter Makkah and Madinah</h3>
    <article>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          Whenever a person travels to a foreign country he has to first apply
          for a visa i.e. the permission to enter that country. Every country
          has its own rules, regulations and requirements for issuing a visa.
          Unless their critera are satisfied they will not issue a visa.
        </li>
        <li>
          One of the countries which is very strict in issuing a visa is the
          United States of America, especially when issuing visas to citizens of
          the third world countries. They have several conditions and
          requirements to be fulfilled before they issue a visa.

          When I visited Singapore, it was mentioned on their immigration form -
          death to drug traffickers. If I want to visit Singapore I have to
          abide by the rules. I cannot say that death penalty is a barbaric
          punishment. Only if I agree with their requirements and conditions
          will I be permitted to enter the country.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Visa – The primary condition required for any human being to enter
          Makkah or Madinah is to say with his or her lips,
          <em>Laa ilaaha ill-Allah Muhammadur Rasoolullah</em>
          meaning that ‘there is no God but Allah and Muhammad (pbuh) is His
          Messenger.’
