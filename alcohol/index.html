    <title>PROHIBITION OF ALCOHOL</title>

    <h1>Why is the consumption of alcohol prohibited in Islam?</h1>
    <h3>Prohibition of alcohol in the Qur’an</h3>
    <article>
      The Glorious Qur’an prohibits the consumption of alcohol in the following
      verse: <br /><br />
      <em
        >“O ye who believe! Intoxicants and Gambling, (Dedication of) stones,
        and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination – of Satan’s handiwork;
        eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.”</em
      >
      &nbsp;[Al-Qur’an 5:90]
    </article>
    <h3>Prohibition of alcohol in the Bible</h3>
    <article>
      The Bible prohibits the consumption of alcohol in the following verses:
      <br /><br />
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <em
            >“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging; and whosoever is
            deceived thereby is not wise.”</em
          >&nbsp;[Book of Proverbs 20:1]
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>“And be not drunk with wine…” </em>&nbsp;[Book of Ephesians 5:18]
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>
    <h3>Alcohol inhibits the inhibitory centre</h3>
    <article>
      The human beings possess an inhibitory centre in their brains. This
      inhibitory centre prevents the person from doing things that he considers
      wrong. For instance, a person does not normally use abusive language while
      addressing his parents or elders. If he has to answer the call of nature,
      his inhibitory centre will prevent him from doing so in public. Therefore
      he uses the toilet.
      <br /><br />
      When a person consumes alcohol, the inhibitory centre itself is inhibited.
      That is precisely the reason that an intoxicated person is found to use
      abusive and foul language and does not realize his mistake even if he is
      addressing his parents. Neither do they talk nor walk properly. They
      misbehave and many even urinate in their clothes.

    <h3>
      Cases of adultery, rape, incest and AIDS are found more among alcoholics
    </h3>
    <article>
      According to National Crime Victimization Survey Bureau of Justice (U.S.
      Department of Justice) in the year 2014 alone everyday on an average 2,318
      rapes took place. The statistics tell us that the majority of the rapists,
      were intoxicated while committing the crime. The same is true in cases of
      molestation. <br /><br />
      According to statistics, 8% of Americans commit incest i.e. one in every
      twelve to thirteen persons in America is involved in incest. Almost all
      the cases of incest are due to intoxication of one or both the persons
      involved.
      <br /><br />
      The Prophet (pbuh) said:
      <br /><br />
      <em
        >“Alcohol is the mother of all evils, the greatest of Major Sins.
        Whoever drinks it may end up committing incest with his mother, his
        maternal aunt and his paternal aunt.”</em
      >&nbsp;[Al Silisilah al-Saheehah, Hadith No. 1853] <br /><br />
      One of the major factors associated with the spread of AIDS, the most
      dreaded disease, is alcoholism.
    </article>
    <h3>Every alcoholic was initially a social drinker</h3>
    <article>
      Many may argue in favour of alcohol by calling themselves ‘social
      drinkers’. They claim that they only have one or two pegs and they have
      self-control and never get intoxicated. Investigations reveal that every
      alcoholic starts as a social drinker. Not a single alcoholic or drunkard
      initially starts drinking with the intention of becoming an alcoholic or a
      drunkard. No social drinker can say that I have been having alcohol for
      several years and that I have so much self-control that I have never been
      intoxicated even a single time.
    </article>
    <h3>
      If a person is intoxicated just once and commits something shameful, it
      will remain with him for a lifetime
    </h3>
    <article>
      Suppose a ‘social drinker’ loses his self-control just once and in a state
      of intoxication he commits rape or incest, then any good and modest human
      being will never forgive himself throughout his life. The damage caused,
      both to the rapist and the victim is irreparable and irreversible.
    </article>
    <h3>Diseases associated with alcoholism</h3>
    <article>
      There are several scientific reasons for the prohibition of consumption of
      intoxicants i.e. alcohol. The maximum number of deaths in the world
      related to any one particular cause is due to the consumption of alcohol.
      Millions of people die every year only because of intake of alcohol. I
      need not go into the details of all the ill effects of alcohol since most
      of them are commonly known. Below is a simple list of few of the alcohol
      related illnesses: <br /><br />

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Cirrhosis of Liver is the most well-known alcohol-associated disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Others are Cancer of Oesophagus, Cancer of Head and Neck, Cancer of
          Liver (Hepatoma), Cancer of Bowel, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oesophagitis, Gastritis, Pancreatitis, and Hepatitis are linked with
          alcohol consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cardiomyopathy, Hypertension, Coronary Atherosclerosis, Angina, and
          Heart Attacks are linked with heavy alcohol intake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strokes, Apoplexy, Fits, and different types of Paralysis are linked
          with alcohol intake.
        </li>

        <li>
          Peripheral Neuropathy, Cortical Atrophy, Cerebellar Atrophy are
          well-known syndromes caused by alcohol consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, with amnesia of recent events,
          confabulations, and retainment of memory to old events with different
          types of paralysis, is mainly due to thiamine deficiency caused by
          excessive alcohol intake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beriberi and other deficiencies are not uncommon among alcoholics.
          Even Pellagra occurs in alcoholics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delirium Tremens is a serious complication that may occur during
          recurrent infection of alcoholics or post-operatively. It also occurs
          during abstention as a sign of withdrawal effect. It is quite serious
          and may cause death even if treated in well-equipped centres.
        </li>
        <li>
          Numerous Endocrine Disorders have been associated with alcoholism,
          ranging from Myxoedema to Hyperthyroidism and Florid Cushing’s
          Syndrome.
        </li>

        <li>
          Haematological ill effects are long and variable. Folic acid
          deficiency, however, is the most common manifestation of alcoholic
          abuse resulting in Macrocytic Anaemia. Zeive’s syndrome is a triad of
          Haemolytic Anaemia, Jaundice, and Hyperlipidemia that follows
          alcoholic binges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thrombocytopenia and other platelet abnormalities are not rare in
          alcoholics.
        </li>
        <li>
          The commonly used tablet metronidazole (Flagyl) interacts badly with
          alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recurrent infection is very common among chronic alcoholics. The
          resistance to disease and the immunological defense system are
          compromised by alcohol intake.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chest infections are notorious in alcoholics. Pneumonia, Lung Abscess,
          Emphysema, and Pulmonary Tuberculosis are all common in alcoholics.
        </li>
        <li>
          During acute alcoholic intoxication, the drunken person usually
          vomits. The cough reflexes, which are protective, are paralyzed. The
          vomitus thus easily passes to the lung, causing Pneumonia or Lung
          Abscess. Occasionally, it may even cause suffocation and death.
        </li>

        <li>
          The ill effects of alcohol consumption on women deserve special
          mention. Females are more vulnerable to alcohol-related Cirrhosis than
          men. During pregnancy, alcohol consumption has a severe detrimental
          effect on the foetus. Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is being recognised more
          and more in the medical profession.
        </li>
        <li>Skin diseases are also related to alcohol indulgence.</li>
        <li>
          Eczema, Alopecia, Nail Dystrophy, Paronychia (infection around the
          nails), and Angular Stomatitis (inflammation of the angle of the
          mouth) are common diseases among alcoholics.
