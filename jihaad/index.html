    <title>JIHAAD IN ISLAM</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>
      Why does Islam allow the Muslims to kill others in the name of 'Jihaad?
    </h1>
    <h3>1. Most misunderstood word - 'Jihaad'</h3>
    <article>
      Jihaad is the most misunderstood word regarding Islam. It is not only
      misunderstood by the Non-Muslims, it is even misunderstood by many of us
      Muslims. Non-Muslims and many Muslims think that Jihaad means any war
      fought by any Muslim for any reason, whether it be for power, whether it
      be for wealth, whether it be for land, whether it be for language, etc.
      Any war fought by any Muslim for any reason, is called as Jihaad. Jihaad
      does not mean any war fought by any Muslim for any reason, whether it be
      for money, whether it be for power, whether it be for land, whether it be
      for language, etc.
    </article>
    <h3>2. Meaning of Jihaad</h3>
    <article>
      'Jihaad' is an Arabic word which comes from the word 'Jahada' which means
      to strive, which means to struggle. So Jihaad basically means to strive
      and struggle. In the Islamic context, Jihaad means to strive and struggle
      against one's own evil inclinations. Jihaad also means to strive and
      struggle to make the society better. Jihaad also means to fight against
      oppression. Jihaad also means to fight in self defense in the battlefield.
      So Jihaad basically means to strive and struggle. For example if a student
      is striving and struggling to pass in the examination, in Arabic we say
      the student is doing Jihaad. He's striving and struggling.
    </article>
    <h3>3. Jihaad can also be done by Non-Muslims</h3>
    <article>
      Many people have a misconception and they think that Jihaad can only be
      done by a Muslim. There are no less than two verses in the Qur'an, which
      say that even Non-Muslims do Jihaad.
    </article>
    <h3>4. Qur'anic Quotations</h3>
    <article>
      <strong> Surah Luqmaan, Chapter No. 31, Verse No. 14,</strong> <br />
      <em
        >“We have enjoined on the human beings to be kind to their parents, in
        travail upon travail the mother bore them and in pain did she give them
        birth”</em
      >
      Immediately after praising the parents, specially the mother, the verse
      continues… <br />
      <strong>Surah Luqmaan, Chapter No. 31, Verse No. 15, says that</strong>
      <br />
      <em
        >“But if your parents (do Jihaad), strive and struggle to make you
        worship somebody else besides Allah (swt) of whom you have no knowledge
        then don't obey them but yet live with them with love and
        compassion”</em
      >
      <br />
      Here the Qur'an is talking about Non-Muslim parents, doing Jihaad,
      striving and struggling to make their children do Shirk, worship somebody
      else besides Allah (swt). <br />
      <strong
        >A similar message is given in Surah Al Ankaboot, Chapter No. 29, Verse
        No. 8, that</strong
      >
      <br />
      <em>
        “We have enjoined on human beings to be kind to the parents but if the
        parents (do Jihaad), strive and struggle to make them worship somebody
        else besides Allah (swt) don't obey them. You all have to return to Me,
        and I will tell you (the truth) of all that you did.”
      </em>
      So here the Qur'an is talking about Non-Muslim parents doing Jihaad.

    <h3>5. Jihaad Fi Sabilish Shaitaan and Jihaad Fi Sabilillah</h3>
    <article>
      Such examples of Qur'an mentioning Non-Muslims doing Jihaad is 'Jihaad Fi
      Sabilish Shaitaan,' Jihaad in the way of Satan. What we Muslims should do
      is 'Jihaad Fi Sabilillah,' Jihaad in the way of Allah. And whenever the
      word 'Jihaad' is mentioned individually, in the Islamic context, it is
      understood to be 'Jihaad Fi Sabilillah'.
    </article>
    <h3>6. Jihaad is not Holy War</h3>
    <article>
      Most of the Non-Muslims including many so called 'Muslim Scholars', they
      translate Jihaad as 'Holy War'. If you translate 'Holy War' into Arabic it
      means 'Harbum Muqaddasah'. If you read the Qur'an or the Hadith, there is
      neither a single Qur'anic verse nor a Hadith, which uses the word 'Harbum
      Muqaddasah'. The word 'Holy War' neither exists in the Qur'an nor in the
      Hadith.
    </article>
    <h3>7. Qitaal</h3>
    <article>
      Jihaad as I mentioned basically means to strive and struggle. One type of
      Jihaad is also fighting in the way of Allah (swt), that is Qitaal in the
      way of Allah (swt). But Jihaad doesn't basically mean a War. There are
      various types of Jihaad like Jihaad bin Nafs - striving and struggling
      against our own evil inclinations, also one type of Jihaad is fighting in
      self defense in the way of Allah (swt).
    </article>
    <h3>
      8. The word 'Jihaad' revealed multiple times in Makkah, but no war in
      Makkah
    </h3>
    <article>
      If we see the life of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), the first thirteen years of
      his Prophethood that he lived in Makkah, there were many Qur'anic verses
      that were revealed in Makkah and many a time in these verses the word
      'Jihaad' was used and never did the Muslims ever physically fight. Only
      when they migrated to Madinah did the War take place. But yet you find the
      word 'Jihaad' in several verses of the Qur'an, which were revealed in
      Makkah.
    </article>
    <h3>9. Qur'anic Quotations</h3>
    <article>
      <strong> Surah Al Ankaboot, Chapter No. 29, verse No. 69, that</strong>
      <br />
      <em
        >“..those who strive In Our (cause), - We will certainly guide them to
        Our paths, for Verily Allah is with those who do right.”
      </em>
      When this verse was revealed there was no war at that time. <br />
      <strong>
        Qur'an says in Surah Al Furqaan, Chapter No. 25, verse No. 52,
        that</strong
      >
      <br />
      <em
        >“Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with
        the utmost strenuousness with the (Qur'an).”</em
      >
      That means you do Jihaad with the Qur'an. Jihaad with the Qur'an means to
      strive to convey the message of Allah (swt). Do you think you are going to
      fight with the Qur'an?
    </article>
    <h3>10. Killing any innocent human being is prohibited in Islam</h3>
    <article>
      One verse of the Qur'an is sufficient to prove that killing any innocent
      human being is strictly prohibited in Islam. It's mentioned in the
      Glorious Qur'an, Surah Al Maa'idah, Chapter 5 Verse 32, Allah says, “…If
      any one killed a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading
      mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed the whole of humanity:
      and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the
      whole of humanity…” If you read the scriptures of the other religions, you
      will not find any verse similar or close to the above verse of the Qur'an,
      which says, “If you kill one innocent human being it is as if you have
      killed the whole of humanity and if you save one human being it is as if
      you have saved the whole of humanity.”
    </article>
    <h3>
      11. For more details refer to the book or lecture of Dr Zakir Naik on the
      topic, 'Terrorism and Jihaad: An Islamic Perspective'.
    </h3>
    <h3>12. Media maligns, brainwashes and dictates minds of people</h3>
    <article>
      The misconception regarding this word 'Jihaad' is created by the Media.
      This word 'Jihaad' wasn't a problem a couple of decades earlier. After
      9/11 it came on top of the charts, Number one. Previously it wasn't there.
      So depending upon how the Media portrays Islam, these misconceptions arise
      in the minds of the Non-Muslims.
