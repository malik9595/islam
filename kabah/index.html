      When Islam is against idol worship, why do the Muslims worship, and bow
      down to the Ka’bah in their prayer?
    </h1>
    <article>
      Ka’bah is the Qiblah i.e. the direction Muslims face during their prayers.
      It is important to note that though Muslims face the Ka’bah during
      prayers, they do not worship the Ka’bah. Muslims worship and bow to none
      but Allah. <br /><br />
      It is mentioned in Surah Al Baqarah Chapter 2 Verse 144: <br />
      <em
        >“We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens: now
        shall We turn thee to a Qiblah that shall please thee. Turn then thy
        face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque: wherever ye are, turn your
        faces in that direction...”</em
      > &nbsp; [Al-Qur’an 2:144]

    <h3>Islam believes in unity</h3>
    <article>
      For instance, if Muslims want to offer Salaah (Prayer), it is possible
      that some may wish to face north, while some may wish to face south. In
      order to unite Muslims in their worship of the One True God, Muslims,
      wherever they may be, are asked to face in only one direction i.e. towards
      the Ka’bah. If some Muslims live towards the west of the Ka’bah they face
      the east and if they live towards the east of the Ka’bah they face the
      west. Similarly if some Muslims live towards the north of the Ka’bah they
      face the south and if they live towards the south of the Ka’bah they face
      the north.

    <h3>Ka’bah is at the Centre of the World Map</h3>
    <article>
      The Muslims were the first people to draw the map of the world. They drew
      the map with the south facing upwards and north downwards. The Ka’bah was
      at the centre. Later, western cartographers drew the map upside down with
      the north facing upwards and south downwards. Yet, Alhamdullilah the
      Ka’bah is at the centre of the world map.

    <h3>Tawaaf around the Ka’bah is for indicating one God</h3>
    <article>
      When the Muslims go to Masjid Al Haram in Makkah, they perform the tawaaf
      or circumambulation round the Ka’bah. This act symbolizes the belief and
      worship of One God, since, just as every circle has one centre, so also
      there is only one Allah (swt) worthy of worship.

    <h3>Hadith of Umar (may Allah be pleased with him)</h3>
    <article>
      Regarding the black stone, hajr al aswad, there is a hadith, attributed to
      the illustrious companion of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), Umar (may Allah
      be pleased with him). <br /><br />
      According to Sahih Al Bukhari, Volume 2, Book of Hajj, Chapter 50, Hadith
      No. 1597: <br /><br />
      Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said,
      <em
        >“No doubt I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit nor harm.
        Had I not seen the Prophet (pbuh) touching (and kissing) you, I would
        never have touched (and kissed) you.”</em
      >

    <h3>People stood on the Ka’bah and gave the adhaan</h3>
    <article>
      At the time of the Prophet, people even stood on the Ka’bah and gave the
      ‘adhaan’ or the call to prayer. One may ask those who allege that Muslims
      worship the Ka’bah, which idol worshipper stands on the idol he worships?
